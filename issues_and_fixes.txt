######Bluetooth pairing issue on dualboot########
#Pair all devices with linux.
#Pair all devices with Windows
Now in the linux terminal:
#install chntpw
#cd /[WindowsSystemDrive]/Windows/System32/config
#chntpw -e SYSTEM opens a console
#Run these commands in that console:
> cd CurrentControlSet\Services\BTHPORT\Parameters\Keys
> # if there is no CurrentControlSet, then try ControlSet001
> # on Windows 7, "services" above is lowercased.
> ls
# shows you your Bluetooth port's MAC address
Node has 1 subkeys and 0 values
  key name
  <aa1122334455>
> cd aa1122334455  # cd into the folder
> ls  
# lists the existing devices' MAC addresses
Node has 0 subkeys and 1 values
  size     type            value name             [value if type DWORD]
    16  REG_BINARY        <001f20eb4c9a>
> hex 001f20eb4c9a
=> :00000 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX ...ignore..chars..
# ^ the XXs are the pairing key
# Make a note of which Bluetooth device MAC address matches which pairing key. The Linux one won't need the spaces in-between.â€‚ Ignore the :00000.

#Switch to root: su - (In more modern versions of Ubuntu, 'sudo -i')
#cd to your Bluetooth config location /var/lib/bluetooth/[bth port  MAC addresses]
Here you'll find folders for each device you've paired with. The folder names being the Bluetooth devices' MAC addresses and contain a single file info. In these files, you'll see the link key you need to replace with your Windows ones, like so:

[LinkKey]
Key=B99999999FFFFFFFFF999999999FFFFF

#sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
